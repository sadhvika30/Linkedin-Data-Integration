# ISO Duration

ISO Duration is a form to specify time intervals in very compact format. The standard is available [Here: ISO 8601 duration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)

DIL supports ISO Duration up to hours. It is usually used to offset a date time backwards, i.e. the duration is subtracted from the
base date time, which is the current date time in most scenarios.
